abstract: 'Research institutions play a vital role in generating
  robust research findings. However, their role in disseminating the evidence underlying
  those findings -- particularly for the purposes of replication -- is often less
  clear. Many economic journals are beginning to provide guidance and infrastructure
  for replication packages, but this is far from standard and does not account for
  organizations that self-publish. Researchers seeking to share replication materials
  must also navigate barriers such as controls around sensitive and proprietary data.
  Thus, there is an open question about the degree to which research institutions
  can and should participate in the publication of replication packages. The Federal
  Reserve Bank of Kansas City has chosen to focus our resources on curation in order
  to balance our mission-driven orientation, security considerations, and capacity
  limitations. The rationale and resulting procedures described below provide one
  possible model for involvement in the publication process, but it is based on a
  unique combination of factors that influence our decision-making. Each organization''s
  landscape and priorities will help dictate the most suitable configuration.'

# Prioritizing Transparency[^1]

The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City (FRB KC) operates with a mission
to work in the public\'s interest by supporting economic and financial
stability. Central to this mission is public and community engagement
that emphasizes trust along with core values such as integrity and
service. These characteristics point towards a strong organizational
alignment with the foundational principles of replication, namely
transparency.

When FRB KC first began exploring reproducibility in earnest, our
researchers were sharing data on an infrequent, ad-hoc basis with full
responsibility for preparing and disseminating their own replication
packages. However, growing library services and evolving journal
expectations drove us to reconsider our approach. An internal data
preservation initiative posed questions about what types of data we
should preserve and, importantly, why. As we considered the historical
and administrative purposes of research data, we also examined
preservation policies and practices in economic journals to better
understand the state of the field[^2]. There, we found a steadily
increasing trend in journals requiring or strongly recommending the
inclusion of replication packages as part of the publication process.

With both our mission and industry trends in mind, FRB KC ultimately
decided to prioritize a high degree of transparency in our approach to
sharing replication packages. Our researchers' findings inform important
economic policies and decision-making, and we determined that a focus on
openness was one way FRB KC could tangibly demonstrate our ongoing
commitment to integrity and public trust. Thus, we elected to establish
a formal process to enable researchers to share underlying data to the
extent possible.

# The Data Release Process

Researchers initiate the data release process, and the Research Library
coordinates the subsequent steps. These steps include legal reviews of
contracts and terms of use, information security assessments, and the
creation of a comprehensive ReadMe document. The ReadMe document
contains vital information such as licenses, file descriptions,
instructions for usage, data source references, and fixity details to
ensure long-term usability.

Currently, our researchers are under no requirements to publish
replication packages; it is up to their discretion to determine when to
initiate the data release process. Those decisions are often driven by a
range of motivations, including journal requirements, media inquiries,
collegial requests, a desire to make research widely available, and
more. However, not all data can be shared in every situation. Potential
barriers include code and data complexity, contractual restrictions,
privacy concerns, and many more.

Despite these challenges, FRB KC confronts obstacles to sharing head-on.
While many journal policies provide exceptions for situations involving
proprietary or confidential data, FRB KC will often seek permission from
data vendors on an ad-hoc basis. We also work to incorporate explicit
language during contract negotiations that allows for
replication-focused sharing. In this way, we have successfully shared
data from a wide range of public and proprietary sources. Appropriate
sharing is also sometimes facilitated through methods such as
aggregation and synthetic data. However, there are still times when
sharing is not feasible, and legal and ethical matters always outweigh
desires for transparency.

Once the review process is complete, researchers have a wide range of
distribution options available. Replication packages may be posted on
the FRB KC website, uploaded to an external repository, emailed to a
requestor, submitted to a journal, or any other means of distribution
needed. Research Library staff are available to help facilitate any
desired publication method, but researchers can also manage distribution
themselves.

The data release process currently has a turnaround time of
approximately three weeks from initiation to publication, but it can
also be expedited when needed and may take additional time if issues
arise. Defining and operationalizing this timeline has required ongoing
relationship-building and negotiations with key stakeholder functions
such as legal and information security. These discussions have centered
on clearly defining researchers' needs and balancing them within the
organization's risk mitigation framework and available resources.

# Resourcing Considerations

The curation process is completed entirely by internal staff since
replication packages are considered public once they leave our internal
systems. Whether posted publicly in a repository or emailed to a single
well-known colleague, we recognize that we no longer have control over
replication files once they have been distributed. As a result, our
curation process ensures that all replication packages meet FRB KC's
standards for sharing with external audiences before being distributed
across any medium.

At this time, we have elected to place less emphasis on the mechanisms
for distribution so that we can instead focus our limited resources on
curation for the reasons outlined above. As we explore future
opportunities to expand publication and preservation practices,
scalability and capacity remain crucial considerations. Every
replication package requires time-consuming context gathering,
stakeholder coordination, and tailored decision-making. Growing demand
for this service requires that we continue to be thoughtful and
intentional in deploying available resources.

# Conclusion

The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City\'s commitment to transparency
and public trust has shaped our approach to publishing replication
packages, and our transition from an informal, ad-hoc approach to a more
structured process has helped promote secure, ethical, and effective
data sharing. In this way, FRB KC research practices continue to
contribute to the overall mission and values of the organization. This
is especially important given that the Federal Reserve System is a
long-lived institution. After more than 100 years of supporting economic
and financial stability, trust in our research is intended to extend
well into the future in addition to informing the audiences of today.

As other research institutions consider their role in the publication of
replication packages, the overall approach should be influenced by
factors such as organizational goals, risk assessments, known
impediments, and available capacity. Comprehensive curation and
publication services are not appropriate for all institutions, and there
are many external partners and resources available to supplement where
needed. However, replication best practices are maturing steadily in the
field of economics and will continue to normalize with time. Research
institutions that proactively consider their role and expectations in
this space will be much better positioned to maintain ongoing trust and
integrity in their findings.
