abstract: 'Abstract: As the leader of the Technology and Data Science team at the

## Background

The Urban Institute is an organization whose mission is to provide
evidence, analysis, and tools to people who make change to ultimately
empower communities and improve people's lives. We define "people who
make change" broadly as policymakers, government agency employees,
advocates, community leaders foundations, corporate leaders, and other
similar actors.

Though Urban as an organization has a number of goals, I would
categorize our primary drivers as 1) to make impact toward our mission
and 2) to fundraise effectively to support that impact and the
organizational supports that make it possible. This is important to
consider later when I discuss organizational priorities around open data
and code.

Similarly, Urban conducts work broadly across many policy areas, however
I might summarize them succinctly as 1) conducting policy research and
evaluations, 2) providing technical assistance on implementation, 3)
producing data and data tools, 4) providing advisory services, 5)
convening experts across sectors, and 6) translating research and
communicating it to targeted audiences. In support of this work, Urban
sometimes posts both the data and code powering the data on its website,
Urban.org.

## Main Thoughts

**Existing Initiatives**

Urban is home to a number of existing initiatives intended to make
progress toward more open data and code. The first is Urban's Data
Catalog (<https://datacatalog.urban.org/>), to which all researchers who
wish to publish code on Urban's website must submit their data and
document their submissions to a minimum extent. The second is Urban's
central library of quality assurance materials and trainings, which
promote open science standards, reproducibility checks, automation in
programming, clear organization, and quality documentation throughout.
The third is Urban's automated R (and soon Stata) themes, templates, and
guides, which allow researchers to more easily automate the full
research pipelines from data collection to publication in R. Urban has
processes in place to comply with the requirements of third parties,
such as the AEA Data Editor and ICPSR among others, to whom Urban is
required to submit or may submit voluntarily. And finally, Urban has a
central team that is available to conduct code reviews and
reproducibility checks on demand.

Urban continues to make improvements in all of these areas, including
adding supporting resources for quality assurance such as an internal
code library, providing additional documentation and examples on Github
for certain projects, improving our automation of publishing systems to
extend to additional content on our website, and revamping and improving
our data catalog experience.

**Successes**

As a result of these efforts, Urban has seen a number of successes that
have led to substantial benefits to the organization. For our external
users and partners, our publicly available data are now better
documented, with a clear license for use, citations are clear and
available, and our impact through open data is easier to see and track.
I have seen better quality assurance materials and process automation
lead to a more streamlined review process that saves time and allows for
rapid iteration and even innovation under tight timelines. The processes
and systems in place have also allowed for more redundancy and reduced
stress on team members when they work well, especially when these
efforts reduced in improved documentation, onboarding, communication,
and collaboration across teams with diverse skill sets and backgrounds.

**Challenges**

Despite our efforts and successes, significant challenges remain. Our
organization is decentralized and funded by many different parties
across government, philanthropy, and the private sector. I have observed
that many of these funders in recent years, especially in the
philanthropic sector, have shifted their focus away from core research
and more toward work that generates impact. I worry that this shift will
lead open data and code efforts to be seen increasingly as "optional"
when so many other "more impactful" activities are vying for the next
marginal funding dollar. In any case, as a result of this landscape,
these open practices are only adopted on a voluntary basis or in certain
cases where required by the funder or journal at Urban.

I also observe that researchers and organizational leadership are not
directly incentivized, outside of the few funding requirements we do
observe (such as the Sloan Foundation, the Arnold Foundation, the
National Science Foundation, and others), by existing priorities to
tackle these challenges. In the scope of our priority focuses on impact
and fundraising, I have observed that while centralized quality
assurance and open code are seen as a priority at Urban, they have been
at times overwhelmed by even higher priorities, especially in light of
my thoughts on funders' changing priorities in this space.

In the meantime, researchers continue to prioritize quality control in
their own decentralized individual projects and efforts. However, in my
experience the majority are not motivated by quality control arguments
to adopt newer open data and code practices, and the strongest
motivation remains funder and journal requirements. Most researchers I
work with see their work and current processes as high quality, just
defined differently across the organization. More importantly, in my
view, is that open data and code efforts are often seen as an additional
layer of bureaucracy and busy work on top of existing requirements, and
thus they are perceived as reducing the agency and academic freedom that
many researchers highly value.

## Conclusion

It is hard for me to see openness and reproducibility change without
increasing the requirements on researchers and institutions from those
funding them and disseminating their work. Ultimately, despite the
short-term perceived costs of increased bureaucracy, I believe these
requirements will bring larger benefits and are worth considering.

I believe it would be wise for advocates for open data and reproducible
research to call for funders and journals to require reproducibility
checks at a minimum, and open data where possible as a next step. I
would also be in favor of third-party reproducibility checks, and/or
marks that certified that a third-party check has been passed and
certain materials are available for reproduction.

I believe that these requirements would improve our clients' confidence
in the quality of the complying institutions, and clearly help us to
differentiate important policy signal from the noise. It would also pave
the way toward a future where more replication studies are feasible.
Urban currently has systems, processes, and materials in place to comply
with these requirements, and the field now has sufficient examples from
peer organizations and journals to enable the rapid spread of best
practices once requirements are in place.
