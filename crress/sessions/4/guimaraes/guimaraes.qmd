abstract: Access to confidential data is often seen as a major obstacle
  to reproducibility. The Banco de Portugal microdata laboratory (BPLIM)
  has been providing access to confidential data for research purposes
  since 2016. Based on our experience, we argue that our data access
  model is an opportunity to demand that researchers integrate good
  reproducibility practices into their research process. Our goal is to
  automate the production of a reproducibility package as part of the
  researcher's process of analyzing confidential data. We hope that this
  approach can overcome the limitations of working with confidential
  data and help certify reproducibility with confidential data. The
  approach we propose can also be adopted by researchers using
  non-confidential datasets.

## Background

The Banco de Portugal Microdata Laboratory (BPLIM) was established in
2016 with the primary goal of promoting external research on the
Portuguese economy by making available data sets collected and
maintained by Banco de Portugal (BdP). By making this information
available to researchers from around the world, BdP aims to support the
development of evidence-based policies and insights that can benefit the
Portuguese economy and society. However, given that some of these data
sets contain highly sensitive information BPLIM had to implement a data
access solution that preserved the confidentiality of the data.

The common approach by other Research Data Centers that make
confidential data available for research involves the provision of
on-site access to accredited external researchers in a secure computing
environment. However, in the case of BPLIM this approach was deemed
undesirable for two reasons. First, because it would limit access to a
handful of researchers who were able to come to the Bank\'s premises.
Second, because there were still concerns that a breach of
confidentiality might occur if individuals from outside the bank could
gain access to original data sets that contained confidential
information.

After an internal debate at the Bank it was decided that the solution to
be adopted by BPLIM had to be based on the following principles:

\- access free of charge and only for scientific purposes;

\- all data should be analyzed on the servers of the Bank;

\- external researchers were granted remote access to the server;

\- confidential datasets placed on the server had to always be
perturbed/masked;

\- researchers could always ask BPLIM staff to run their scripts on the
original data.

The general workflow defined for data access at BPLIM was the following.
After a research project is approved and the external researchers are
accredited an account is opened on the BPLIM external server. External
researchers gain access to a computing environment that does not allow
users to transfer files to and from the server. They have access to a
restricted area where standard software such as *Stata*, *R*, *Julia*
and *Python* are available. Since there is no connection to the
internet, installation of specific packages has to be requested from the
staff. The datasets for the project are placed in a read-only folder.
For the confidential datasets what is placed in the account of the
researcher are perturbed versions of the data (noise is added to the
original data). The researcher implements all scripts based on the data
he/she has available and produces the (non-valid) outputs required for
the project. Once researchers complete this task, they can ask BPLIM
staff to rerun their scripts, this time using the original confidential
data. For this process to be successful BPLIM staff must first run the
scripts using the same data as the researcher to verify that the scripts
written by the researchers reproduce exactly the outputs (typically
graphs and/or tables). This process is done in a different server (BPLIM
internal server). Only upon completion of this first step can BPLIM
staff modify the scripts, this time to read the original data and
regenerate the intended outputs . These outputs are then subject to
standard output control checks for confidential data and delivered to
the researcher.

## Main Thoughts

Over time we have come to realize that this somewhat cumbersome process
of running the code thrice, first by the researcher on the perturbed
data, second by BPLIM staff again on the perturbed data, and finally, on
the original data was in fact an exercise on reproducibility. Even
though the reproducibility check was on the perturbed data it was
already a very good assurance that a reproducibility check would hold on
the original data.

We realized that a great deal of our work involved reproducing the
results obtained by the researchers with the perturbed data and that led
us to look at ways to improve our workflow. It became obvious that the
process could be streamlined and would be more efficient if researchers
adhered to the best practices on reproducibility. Hence, as part of our
strategy, we have decided to raise awareness of our researchers to the
need of implementing good practices on reproducible research. We have
been doing this by several means. For example, we have held practical
workshops which are designed to enhance the skills of our researchers.
For these workshops we invite leading experts to present best practices
and recent developments on data analysis. We also provide direct advice
to the researchers, prepare templates and documentation, and make
available tools that facilitate the analysis of our datasets
(particularly for more complex tasks such as building a panel or
calculation of specific variables).

On the other end, it was also obvious that there was margin for
improvement on our work sequence. One possible improvement was the
assurance that the computing environment used by the researcher on
BPLIM\'s external server was identical to that used by BPLIM staff when
reproducing the code. Thus, for the case of researchers that work with
open-source software, we have been incentivizing researchers to work
with Singularity containers. This facilitates our work because we are
sure that our reproducibility check is implemented in the same
self-contained environment that was used by the researcher. Researchers
that use Stata can resort to containers but in that case, it is easier
to control the environment because we install all packages on a folder
that is specific to each project and have developed tools that
facilitate comparison of the Stata ado files across environments. (all
tools are publicly available and can be found at
https://github.com/BPLIM/Tools/tree/master/ados/General.)

More recently, we have worked on shifting the burden of the
reproducibility check to the researcher itself. We are developing an
application that we are presently testing with a select number of
researchers. The application is targeted mainly at researchers that use
BPLIM\'s (perturbed) confidential datasets but we hope to eventually
convince all other users to take advantage of it. To illustrate, we
provide a screenshot of the application:

Before requesting a replication from BPLIM using the original data the
researcher must first validate his/her code by successfully submitting
the scripts through BPLIM\'s Replication application. The process
involves selecting the main script as well as all the required
dependencies created by the researcher. The folder structure used by the
researcher is replicated and the BPLIM datasets have to be read from the
(read-only) data folder. All intermediary output files must be created
during the replication (it is however possible to start from an
intermediary output file. In that case, the intermediary file must have
been validated in a prior run. BPLIM will then copy the file to the
(read-only) data folder.).

The researcher then uses the application to run the code (see Figure 2
for a completed run). The code must run from top-to-bottom and produce
no errors. If the run is successful, then implementation on the original
data requires only that BPLIM staff changes the relative paths to the
data folder and rerun the code. A side advantage of this process is that
it automatically produces a replication package for the researcher.
Stored in the folder are all replication scripts, the output files, as
well as two additional files, one fully characterizing the software
environment, and another *json* file containing a listing of all scripts
used in the replication. If we add the definition file used to produce
the container (or a listing of all packages and respective versions)
then we have a full replication package (except for the data).

## Conclusion

Our goal at BPLIM is to make sure that all researchers create their
replication packages as an integrated part of their research process.
The fact that we are the ones running the code on the original data
should be seen as an opportunity to request that researchers make
reproducible code while implementing their research.

In the ideal situation that we envision, researchers download a template
for the definition file of the Singularity container, customize that
template by adding and testing the packages they need, and share with us
the definition file. Based on that definition file we build the
container for the project and make it available on our external server.
The researcher then uses the container to implement the analysis and
when he/she is ready to obtain results based on the original data he
must first validate the scripts using our application. The researcher
can go through this process multiple times and each time a replication
package will be created. Apart from the data, all files can be publicly
shared, and the replication package created at BPLIM should be easily
customized for submission to any data editor.

We are already implementing this solution for all new projects that use
confidential data. However, we hope that over time we can convince all
researchers at BPLIM to work with Singularity containers and go through
the same validation steps that are needed for projects that deal with
confidential data.

Projects that are implemented in BPLIM have additional advantages when
it comes to reproducibility. First, because all BPLIM datasets are
versioned and registered with a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) we are
sure that the original data is exactly identified. Second, the computing
environment is stable, and the software packages used by researchers are
specific to each project. Finally, if external researchers have used
BPLIM confidential data then there is an assurance that their code was
reproduced at some point.

Ultimately, whether the scientific work is reproducible depends on the
researchers. But we hope that integrating reproducibility into the
research process with confidential data, provides a way to alleviate the
inconvenience of third parties that cannot access the original data and
want to verify reproducibility of the results.
