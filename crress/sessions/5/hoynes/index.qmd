This article provides a status update on reproducibility in the
Economics profession. This includes a particular emphasis on
quantitative research. And a chronology of the role the American
Economic Association has taken in this progress.

## Background

I am an economist and study poverty and inequality and the role of the
social safety net in family and child wellbeing. I want to start by
positioning myself and my background a little bit, as it relates to the
conversation today. Over the past decade or more, I have engaged in a
variety of professional service activities that are linked to
reproducibility and open science. First, I am currently a member of the
Committee on National Statistics at the National Academies of Science,
Engineering and Medicine, where we discuss a range of issues around
data, replication and reproducibility. I was a member of the Commission
on Evidence Based Policymaking, and there we made recommendations around
administrative data and linkages balancing access and privacy. I mention
these experiences because in Economics there has been tremendous growth
in the use of confidential, proprietary or administrative data and there
are significant challenges in open science goals around these data.
Second, I spent a decade as a Co-Editor of journals under the American
Economic Association, first at AEJ: Economic Policy and subsequently at
the American Economic Review, the flagship journal of the association.
While a Co-Editor at the American Economic Review, and also a member of
the AEA Executive Committee, I Co-Chaired the search committee for an
AEA Data Editor. This is the position that Lars Vilbuber holds.

## Main Thoughts

The theme of this session is how differences in support for
reproducibility exist across the social sciences. Hence I organize my
comments to focus on the status of reproducibility in Economics and what
might make it different from other social sciences.

### I. The (possibly unique) role of the American Economic Association

The American Economic Association (AEA) has a lot of "market power"
because it controls a large share of the high quality journal landscape.
The AEA journals include the American Economic Review, the American
Economic Review: Insights, and American Economic Journals (there are
four of these), \[as well as the Journal of Economic Literature and the
Journal of Economic Perspectives\]. The AEA started with the American
Economic Review (AER) and is one of the "top 5" general interest
publications in Economics. The AER became so clogged with quality
submissions and accepted papers (with 2 year waits between acceptance
and publication) that the AEA expanded the number of issues that they
produced per year. This led the AER to publish a disproportionate share
of the articles in Economics top 5 journals.

Following the success of the AEA journals and the strong budget
situation at the association, the AEA decided to expand and add
additional journals to its portfolio. We added AER: Insights, featuring
short format articles with quick turnaround, in an attempt to compete
with publications in Science and PNAS. We also added four top field
journals to try to occupy the space just below the top 5, perhaps
wrestling some of the market from for profit journals such as those
published by Elsevier. This became the four American Economic Journals
(AEJ) - AEJ: Applied Economics, AEJ: Economic Policy, AEJ:
Microeconomics, and AEJ: Macroeconomics.

So if you put this all together, there\'s a lot of the journal space
(and highly ranked journal space) that the American Economic Association
runs.

With this "market power" and over period of time the association made a
series of moves in the area of open science. This approach came about
through both top down and bottom up mechanisms. There was definitely
interest among the AEA Executive Committee including the lead editors of
the American Economic Review, first Penny Goldberg followed by Esther
Duflo. But there was also a perspective that percolated up from the
membership. This may have come in part in response to the replication
crises in other disciplines. Additionally, many of us engaged in
training graduate students desired data for students to get practice and
skills.

Overall, I think the AEA views itself as having the potential to take
actions that set standards that are adopted more broadly in the
profession. (I hope the association takes the same approach to dealing
with sexual harassment in Economics.)

### II. AEA Actions 

So what did the AEA do?

They set up the AEA RCT Registry. As stated on the website: "Randomized
Controlled Trials (RCTs) are widely used in various fields of economics
and other social sciences. As they become more numerous, a central
registry on which trials are on-going or complete (or withdrawn) becomes
important for various reasons: as a source of results for meta-analysis;
as a one-stop resource to find out about available survey instruments
and data. Because existing registries are not well suited to the need
for social sciences, in April 2012, the AEA executive committee decided
to establish such a registry for economics and other social sciences."

Second, and more pertinent to this conversation, the American Economic
Review adopted a requirement to post data and code for all accepted
papers. It initially was very much on the honor system but it was felt
that this was a good first step. There were some staff who worked on
confirming that files were uploaded, but not much beyond that.

After some time, there was an evaluation of how this was going. The
answer was, not so well. Often times, the data and code would be
incomplete. Documentation would be insufficient. It would be difficult
for reuse, and it wasn\'t replicable. There was a recognition that you
need skilled leadership and staff for this to work.

This led to the next stage of open science at the AEA. We recognized
that we had the budget to do more. The AEA compensates all journal
editors a pretty fair wage for the work. And the view was perhaps we
should take the next step to hire someone who would work with the
journal editors as well as with the AEA Executive Committee to create a
more robust system for reproducibility. There was a discussion about
whether or not we wanted this individual to be a practicing academic who
has skills in this area, or whether we just needed to build up more
staffing. We reached out to folks in other disciplines to find out what
they were doing. We liked the model at the American Statistical
Association who had appointed an academic researcher who also had skills
in open science.

We had a search for this new position which we called the AEA Data
Editor. From the job ad, the data editor would "Collaborate with journal
editors and executive committee; design and oversee implementation of
strategy for archiving & curating data, promoting reproducible
research." In short, we needed an architect of the new system as well as
a manager and implementer. We were lucky to attract Lars Vilhuber to the
position. He is a practicing academic researcher who also has the skills
in open science, and could work at the frontier.

## Conclusion

I will conclude by providing some thoughts about where the gaps are and
where we need to continue to make progress.

First, we need to continue to revisit the staffing of the Data Editor's
operation. Are the resources sufficient for the needed work?

Second, we need to devise approaches to deal with confidential data. It
is increasingly common for AEA journal papers to use proprietary or
confidential data. Examples include government administrative data, data
from firms, and so on. Researchers typically do not have the ability to
post this data. Therefore, replication and reproducibility has to get
over a very large hurdle with these data.

Third, we need to build on the success of pre-registration of RCTs. For
example, should the journal require pre-registration? Should this be
expanded to pre-registration of quasi experimental papers? And
relatedly, should the AEA create an RCT Editor to check compliance with
pre-registration plan?

Finally, we need do more analysis and landscaping to investigate to
where the gaps are in the Economics discipline more broadly, and what
role the AEA can take to continue to move us towards further progress in
open science.
