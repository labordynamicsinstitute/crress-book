## Introduction

The scholarship of teaching and learning in economics documents multiple
efforts to bring the quantitative dimension of our professional work
closer to the undergraduate college curriculum.

Economics educators describing data-focused assignments and projects
(Wolfe, 2020; Halliday, 2019; Wuthisatian and Thanetsunthorn, 2019;
Marshall and Underwood, 2019; Mendez-Carbajo, 2015 & 2019) highlight the
data-finding step of these projects. Even when the datasets are directly
provided to the students, (e.g., Easton, 2020) the instructors emphasize
the broader literacy dimensions of the assignments. However, there is
neither professional consensus about how to build data-literacy skills
(Wuthisatian and Thanetsunthorn, 2019) or much actual research on their
mastery among economics students (Halliday, 2019).

In this chapter, we document baseline proficiency levels among
undergraduate college students related to identifying data series and
their sources. We also put forward an accessible pedagogical strategy to
develop basic reproducibility skills.

We argue reproducibility should be part of the undergraduate curriculum
in economics because it is a valuable professional skill to be developed
throughout the curriculum by consistently citing the data sources used
in economic arguments. We must instill the practice leading by example
and enrolling the help of librarians

## Expected Proficiencies

There is a natural overlap regarding the development of data-literacy
skills between economics and library science: both disciplines value it
and contribute to its development.

The two seminal descriptions of data literacy expected proficiencies
among undergraduate students are provided by Hansen (2012) and Pothier
and Condon (2019). The first of the seven broad competencies of
economics majors named by Hansen directly address data provenance. It
states: "Access existing knowledge: \[...\] Track down economic data and
data sources. Find information about the generation, construction, and
meaning of economic data."

The library science perspective provided by Pothier and Condon is
articulated through seven expected data competencies of economics and
business majors. The last one states: "Data ethics: The principles of
data ethics are built on data ownership, intellectual property rights,
appropriate attribution and citation, and confidentiality and privacy
issues involving human subjects."

The utilitarian and ethical aspects of data reproducibility outlined
above are bridged by the American Economic Association's (AEA) (2020)
Data and Code Availability Policy, which clearly states "All source data
used in the paper shall be cited, following the AEA Sample References."
However, the scholarship documenting the collaboration in this area
between instructional economics faculty and librarians is limited.
Neither the calls by economics instructors (McGrath and Tiemann, 1985;
Li and Simonson, 2016; Mendez-Carbajo, 2016) nor the experiences
documented by librarians (Wheatley, 2020; Wilhelm, 2021; Waggoner and
Yates Habich, 2020) appear to have broad impact.

## Evidence of Broad Data Literacy Skills

Mendez-Carbajo (2020) documents baseline levels of data literacy
competency in several areas key to the accurate and ethical use of data
for communication and decision-making among high school and college
students.

In the online economic education module produced by the Federal Reserve
Bank of St. Louis "FRED Interactive: Information Literacy", two separate
groups of high school students (*N*= 450) and college students (*N*=
912) answer seven pre-test questions. The questions are mapped to the
data literacy competencies described by both Pothier and Condon (2019)
and Hansen (2012).

The analysis finds effectively identical levels of average baseline data
literacy competency between high school and college students. However,
it also documents much higher levels of perceived self-efficacy among
college students than among high school students. In other words,
college students are no more knowledgeable or skilled than high school
students but are significantly more confident in their work. This
finding highlights a major challenge for instructors working to develop
the expected proficiencies identified in the literature: the average
college student is unduly comfortable in their limited understanding of
the primary sources of economic data.

## Evidence of Narrow Reproducibility Skills

During the fall semester of 2020, we distributed a short online
assignment to all 854 students enrolled in two different upper-division
economics courses offered by a large public university in the United
States.

On average, the students are slightly above 20 years of age, 49%
identify themselves as female, 21% identify as non-White racial or
ethnic minorities, and 92% report English is their native language.
Academically, 87% of students are business, economics, or finance majors
and hold a grade point average of 3.41. Also, 68% of students are
currently enrolled in a statistics course required by their program and,
on average, have previously completed more than one and a half economics
courses.

The assignment had three sections:

-   First, the students were directed to read a brief, 900-word, essay
    on [how to create data citations with
    FRED®](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/page1-econ/2020/10/21/data-citations-with-fred).
    This essay provided background on the value of good data citations
    for practitioners of economics and could be used as reference
    material for the next two sections of the assignment.

-   Second, the students were directed to read two short \--under 600
    words, economic essays. See them
    [here](https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/es/04/ES0427.pdf)
    and
    [here](https://files.stlouisfed.org/research/publications/economic-synopses/2020/10/08/renewable-sources-of-electricity-where-excess-capacity-is-built-in.pdf).
    Each included a line graph of economic data. In the text, the
    authors referenced the data series and their sources while
    interpreting the quantitative information presented in the graph.

-   Third, the students were asked to complete three tasks: identify the
    data series discussed in the essay; identify the sources of the data
    series discussed in the essay; and identify the missing elements of
    a data citation provided in the essay.

The assignment was completed in its entirety by 501 students. Table 1
reports our findings.

Note: Data Literacy Scores: 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒= (#𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡 𝐴𝑛𝑠𝑤𝑒𝑟𝑠 − #𝐼𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡
𝐴𝑛𝑠𝑤𝑒𝑟𝑠) / (#𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡 𝐴𝑛𝑠𝑤𝑒𝑟𝑠)

We document very weak student data literacy competencies associated with
narrow reproducibility skills. Data literacy scores related to correctly
identifying the sources of the data or recognizing an incomplete data
citation are very low. Moreover, we document a frequent misconception of
confusing the data source with the distributor.

These findings have practical implications for instructors, whether they
are librarians or economic educators. Our work suggests there is a
substantial instructional opportunity to help students develop the
ability to recognize data series and their sources. In that regard,
disambiguating the roles of data distributors and data sources can
potentially yield large benefits to students, who would be able to
acquire a more sophisticated understanding of how data are created and
made available.

## Proposed Instructional Intervention

We propose a broad instructional intervention for economics instructors
reflecting the fact that correctly citing the data is a foundational
literacy skill.

-   Lead students by example and consistently name the sources of all
    data referenced or used in your teaching.

-   Embed this practice in all your teaching, regardless of the type or
    subject of the course.

-   Enroll the help of librarians by leveraging their ongoing
    instructional outreach on information literacy to include data
    citations.

Proficiency in identifying data sources is foundational to the
development of reproducibility skills. The earlier and the more
frequently students are exposed to best practices in data citations, the
more effortlessly they will be able to adopt sophisticated professional
replicability practices.

## Conclusion

Reproducibility should be part of the undergraduate curriculum in
economics:

-   It is a valuable professional skill that shows the background work
    that goes into doing economic research. Citing the sources of the
    data makes research work more thorough.

-   This skill should be developed throughout the curriculum. This skill
    is not particular or exclusive to econometrics or statistics
    courses.

-   The first step is to consistently cite the data sources used in
    economic arguments. This includes data tables, plots, and in-text
    references.

-   We must instill the practice by leading by example. Economics
    educators should enroll the help of librarians in developing this
    skill among students.
