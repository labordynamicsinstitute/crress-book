## Introduction

In the summer of 2015, a company called Ashley Madison was hacked and
over seven million users' data was leaked (Lord, 2017). Data breaches
like this are unfortunately common, but as Ashley Madison was
specifically created to facilitate infidelity, the social fallout of the
breach was more harmful than most. After the breach and subsequent
fall-out, which included many individuals being publicly named and
shamed after their information was found in the customer records, many
users of the site ended up getting divorced, some lost their jobs, and
there were multiple confirmed reports of self-harm (Baraniuk, 2015).

Several researchers saw the data breach as an opportunity to advance
their research. They used the leaked data to explore different questions
about user demographics, geography, and risk-taking behavior and
published the results in multiple peer-reviewed articles (Billau, 2017;
Vedantam, 2016). However, in order to be published, these studies first
had to be approved by their university's Institutional Review Board
(IRB).

IRBs are intended to reduce the potential risks and harms in research
proposals that involve human subjects (or data thereof) and are often
perceived as a marker of credibility for ethical research. All IRBs use
something called the Common Rule, which is a set of federal guidelines
that dictate how to conduct ethical research, and there is a stipulation
in it that says if data is already public, then there is little
potential for risk or harm for it to be used in research. It makes no
stipulations about how that data became public. In fact, IRBs have no
remit to review secondary uses of data, with bio-specimen data as the
sole exception. To an IRB, public data is considered low risk regardless
of how that data was obtained, and regardless of how sensitive the data
is, and evaluating its use is not within their scope of review.
Researchers got their studies approved by their IRBs, and academics
continue to use and cite Ashley Madison data in publications. As a
result, many more people see the leaked data and names of the implicated
humans than would have had those papers never been published.

## Nonconsensual Porn and Nonconsensual Data

There are parallels between the use of leaked data sets like the Ashley
Madison hack, and the viewing of nonconsensual pornography (NCP). For
the unfamiliar, NCP is \"the distribution of sexually graphic images or
videos of an individual without their consent in the context of an
intimate relationship," (Carter, 2021). Perpetrators of NCP sometimes
upload photos or videos of their victims onto pornography websites,
which allow many more people to view them. Like most platforms, these
websites often use engagement metrics, like view counts, which help
determine if a video is "popular", with more popular media receiving
more promotion. From a victim's perspective, the more people who see
their image or video, the worse the mental and/or emotional harm. While
the original perpetrator inflicted a significant harm, that harm gets
compounded every time it gets viewed or shared by other people, and by
viewing it, it raises the likelihood that someone else will view it.

When researchers use data that was collected nonconsensually,
unethically, or illegally, it has the potential to amplify the harm of
the original data collector by pointing other people to it. Using
unethical data for research is not the moral equivalent of the original
hack, but there are many circumstances where it may still be considered
morally wrong. The fact that the Common Rule and IRBs don't have the
mechanisms necessary to address this issue means that we need more tools
to fully judge the needs and bounds of ethical research (Jordan, 2022).
Fortunately, there are many disciplines and scholars that have developed
theoretical tools and practices we can use to improve the ethical
conduct of research. I offer several areas that have been personally
productive, though there are many others that can be used.

## Intersectional Feminism, Queer Theory, Sex Education, and Critical Theory

The first area that has been helpful for developing a fuller
understanding of consent is intersectional feminism. Feminism is an
interdisciplinary approach to addressing oppression related to gender
identity and expression. Intersectionality is a theory that when someone
has more than one marginalized identity (e.g., being a Black woman), the
combination of those identities produces a greater risk than the sum of
their parts (Crenshaw, 2006). Intersectional feminism interrogates
oppression on multiple fronts including gender, race, class, disability,
and others, especially how these oppressions interact with each other.
These theories have much to say about what informed consent should look
like, especially when it comes to bodily autonomy and agency. An
intersectional feminist approach to informed consent will ensure that
participants have control over their participation in a research study,
individual control over their personal data, and communal control over
communal data (Sterling, 2011; Fiesler, McCann, Frye & Brubaker, 2018).
Informed consent can sometimes be framed as a liability waiver for
institutions. Intersectional feminism would reframe informed consent as
an expression of care for the wellbeing of the person which may
supersede the research goals of the researchers or the legal liability
of the university.

A second helpful area is queer theory. Queer theorists critique dominant
social expectations of sexual orientation and gender identity (Cohen,
1997). Informed consent can sometimes mirror hetero-patriarchal models
of power by framing consent as something only certain people are
qualified to give (cis, heterosexual men), while others (LGBTQ people)
are disqualified, for example, the FDA's ban on gay and bisexual men
donating blood (Human Rights Campaign, 2020). Integrating queer theory
and listening to the LGBTQ community can aid in analyzing how certain
processes can unintentionally reify discriminatory ways of thinking, and
they can help us move toward more inclusive ways of achieving informed
consent (Edenfield, 2019; de Heer, Brown & Cheney, 2021).

A third area is sexual education and the BDSM community. Inclusive and
evidence-based sex educators have developed models of affirmative and
enthusiastic consent that are sensitive to context (Center for Sex
Education, 2016). Bondage/Discipline, Dominance/Submission, Sadism, and
Masochism (BDSM) are consensual sexual acts that involve a power dynamic
between partners. This kind of sex has a higher potential for risk
because there are elements of pain or power involved and the BDSM
community has developed many practices around consent and communication
to mitigate those risks such as safe words (Dunkely & Brotto, 2020).
These practices include experiences ranging from in-person to remote
relationships, sometimes involving people's bodies while other times
involving domination over personal documents or computers (Vogt &
Goldman, 2018). Sex education and BDSM have richer, more nuanced
theories and consent practices than most researchers at universities.

A fourth area is critical theory, in particular its analysis of power
and push for social change. Critical theory takes many forms and is
often integrated into existing disciplines as a way to challenge
structural assumptions and redistribute resources and opportunities
within them, such as critical legal studies, critical pedagogy, and
others. A critical approach to consent would be attuned to who has power
within an informed consent transaction, who doesn't, and attempt to
redress the asymmetrical dynamic. Applying a critical theory approach to
informed consent can produce some unanticipated results. For example,
the Panama Papers were a set of leaked documents exposing offshore
financial transactions including criminal tax evasion, money laundering,
and other financial crimes around the world (Fitzgibbon & Hudson, 2021).
This was likely a situation where the material was obtained unlawfully
and without the consent of the people whose information was publicized.
Hundreds of papers and many books have been written that detail the
Panama Papers and the individuals named in them. A traditional approach
to informed consent would say that the Panama Papers leak was a wrongful
violation of privacy. A critical consent approach would disregard claims
of privacy by the victims because of the nature of the information
leaked, namely a highly organized global financial system used by the
rich and powerful to hide assets at the expense of the poor and
powerless. Informed consent with a critical theory lens inverts
traditional power dynamics, meaning that some rules about research
ethics should be broken when following them would cause inequitable
outcomes.

## New Models of Consent

When you look across the areas of intersectional feminism, queer theory,
the LGBTQ community, sex educators, the BDSM community, and critical
theory, there are commonalities that can be pulled out to help develop a
better framework of consent in research. Using these as reference
points, informed consent must be at least three things: revocable,
ongoing, and contextual.

Revocability means that after you give your consent to something, you
can change your mind at any time and for any reason. Current research
practice does this somewhat. Most consent forms state that research
participants can stop their participation at any time, but there are
many informal and implicit forces that discourage this. Participants may
feel that by changing their minds they would inconvenience or disappoint
the researchers, who are in a position of authority. Some participants
may be persuaded by the sunk cost fallacy that if they've done something
long enough, they might as well finish it even if they would prefer not
to. In general, research participant consent is revocable only during
the data collection phase. Once that data is used to publish something,
there is almost nothing that a participant can do to remove their data
from the study.

Ongoing consent means that the 'one and done' model of most research is
inadequate. In practice, it means frequent points of intentional
communication gauging the interest of the participants in continuing in
the research study. This does not have to devolve into performative
check-ins that likely produce consent fatigue (Ranisch, 2021). The modes
of ongoing consent should adapt to the environment and be naturally
integrated into the requirements of the participant experience, so that
providing or revoking consent is both easy and perceived as casual. In
practice, this can look like introducing several points in a study where
participants have to opt-in to continuing, with the expectation that if
they don't, they automatically discontinue participation. Sometimes
called contextual consent or just-in-time consent, this makes leaving a
study mid-way through seem less interruptive or socially uncomfortable
(IF, 2022).

Contextual consent means that there isn't a template or formula for
getting consent that can be applied across all research studies. When
people consent to having sex, it is for specific people, places, and
times. Giving consent to have sex once does not mean that you consent to
sex with that person at any time and place in the future. Contextual
consent adapts to the specific conditions it is being offered in and
adjusts how it is communicated. In practice, this could look like
developing unique consent methods for different populations that are
attentive to the cultural and rhetorical differences, even if the
research protocol is otherwise the same. For some populations, the
standard written forms of consent using academic language may be
adequate. For other populations, offering techniques using visual,
auditory, narrative, behavioral, or game-based methods might be better
suited to get meaningful consent

Integrating these informed consent practices into human subject research
will significantly improve the experience of participants as well as
reduce the potential for unethical data collection and sharing. Academia
has many justifications to ignore informed consent. Most times consent
is neglected, the subsequent risks are distributed unequally among
participants. The people who are put at the most risk are usually the
people who are already the most vulnerable: women, children, people who
are LGBTQ, non-binary, disabled, poor, people of color, and many others.
Researchers have a responsibility to conduct research ethically and with
respect for individual privacy needs and expectations. Using these
consent practices by integrating intersectional feminism, queer theory,
the LGBTQ community, sex education, BDSM, and critical theory can
increase the quality of research and respect the dignity of the
participants.

An admittedly difficult area for applying these frameworks is when the
circumstances of data collection and informed consent are more
quotidian. The examples used above are dramatic when compared with most
of the common research practices such as collecting public social media
data from places like Facebook, Reddit, or Twitter. When the consent
obtained is ambiguous, when the data being collected isn't particularly
sensitive, or when the potential for significant social benefit is high,
applying these theoretical tools isn't straightforward. Reasonable
people can, and often do, disagree as to what ethical values are at
stake and how to adjudicate them. The unfortunate ethical gray area this
produces is still better than having clear but inequitable guidelines.

## Final Thoughts

It is highly unlikely that any rules developed to address the growing
complexities of research ethics, especially in technology spaces, will
be able to address every possible ethical dilemma that arises. The four
areas offered above are tools that can help with some of the gaps
currently found in research ethics, but they need to be constantly
reexamined and supplemented as new issues present themselves. Ethical
research is a horizon, not a place; we never arrive. By prioritizing the
wellbeing of the most vulnerable and marginalized people in our
communities and continually inventing better models of informed consent,
we can take more confident steps towards that horizon.
