  The rise of sophisticated empirical research in the social sciences has brought new challenges to research transparency. Computational reproducibility, which checks if results can be duplicated using the same data and methods, often fails due to insufficient detailing or analytical mistakes. This essay emphasizes the importance of teaching reproducibility in the classroom at the graduate level and provides some suggestions for practical assignments that teach real-world reproducibility challenges.

## Background

The prominence of empirical research in the social sciences is rising
due to advances in computing and the growing availability of detailed
datasets. It is now common for researchers to run analyses using
millions of data points derived from multiple data sources, often
accomplished by writing many thousands of lines of code in multiple
programming languages.

With this increased complexity, the potential for opaque errors also
grows. This concern is not just theoretical: one recent study revealed
that the results from many published papers cannot be reproduced from
the code and data provided by the original authors (Chang and Li,
forthcoming). Part of the reason for this problem is that most
researchers receive little or no training in how to create reproducible
analyses. This essay delves into the importance of reproducibility and
advocates for its inclusion in graduate-level education.

## What is reproducibility?

Reproducibility is a form of replicability. A replicable study yields
the same results when it is repeated by other researchers (Molitor and
Reif 2021). Replication can fail for a number of different reasons. For
example, the original results may have happened by chance, or perhaps
mistakes were made when analyzing the data. This essay focuses on
computational reproducibility, a narrow type of replication that checks
whether a researcher using the *same* data and methods as the original
study can exactly reproduce the original results.

There are many reasons why computational reproducibility may not be
satisfied. Researchers might not provide sufficient details about how
they processed and analyzed their data. If such decisions are not
properly explained, researchers may be unable to reproduce the original
results. In other cases, the original analysis may contain mistakes,
e.g., using the wrong data or the wrong model, mishandling missing data,
or copy/pasting the wrong results to a table.

## Teaching reproducibility

Creating a reproducible analysis helps reduce mistakes that emerge
during data analysis, such as errors from manual tasks like copy/pasting
numbers or reformatting data files. In addition, a well-documented,
reproducible analysis offers a platform for others to learn from and
build upon the research, an aspect highlighted in a recent essay by
Molitor and Reif (2021).

However, achieving computational reproducibility is difficult.
Challenges range from poor organization, which can result in
irreproducible intermediate files, to non-unique sorts in the
researcher's code that cause results to change with each execution.
Additional problems can stem from reliance on add-on packages, which
evolve over time, or inconsistencies between different operating
systems.

Given the importance of computational reproducibility, there\'s a
pressing need to incorporate it into the educational system.
Unfortunately, reproducibility is rarely taught in the classroom. Some
students learn how to write reproducible code from older students or
their advisors, but that instruction is often incomplete. A better
approach would be standardized instruction in a classroom environment.

At what stage of the learning process should students be taught how to
write reproducible code? It is not a necessary skill for all social
science researchers---for example, a theoretical macroeconomist who
spends little time analyzing large datasets does not need to learn
detailed techniques of reproducibility. While the optimal point of
learning may vary depending on the program, for many disciplines like
economics it would be best incorporated into an applied data analysis
course in the second year of graduate school. These courses, often
labeled "applied econometrics," teach standard analytical tools like
regression analysis and could be easily modified to include additional
material on reproducibility. This additional material would teach
students how to organize and document analyses, and impart technical
skills specific to certain programming languages.

Practical assignments are the best way to learn about reproducibility
principles and techniques. Consider, for instance, an assignment where
students are asked to download publicly available survey data and
estimate the effect of state-level cigarette taxes on cigarette
consumption using a difference-in-differences model. Alongside
estimating a regression model and explaining their results, students
could be asked to submit documented data and code that complies with the
American Economic Association's requirements for a published paper.

After submission, students can attempt to run each other's analyses.
Many students will find it difficult to run code written by somebody
else, especially if it was written in an unfamiliar programming
language. This exercise provides a good simulation of the
reproducibility challenges commonly faced by researchers, and will help
the students write code that can be reproduced more easily.

## Conclusion

Computational reproducibility is essential for transparent and reliable
research. Its importance not only lies in the accuracy and verification
of research findings but also in fostering a community of learners who
can effectively build upon each other's work.

Including computational reproducibility in the curriculum is crucial for
equipping future researchers with the skills necessary to traverse the
increasingly complex field of data analysis. There are growing resources
available for both teachers and students to enhance their understanding
and application of computational reproducibility.[^1] These resources
offer valuable guidance on general and technical issues associated with
reproducibility. As empirical research becomes increasingly complex, the
importance of practicing computational reproducibility will continue to
grow.
